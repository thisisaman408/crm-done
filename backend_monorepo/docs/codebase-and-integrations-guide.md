## 1. Executive Summary & System Invariants

Resyl is an enterprise-grade real estate CRM and marketing automation engine powering two completely distinct business models under a unified codebase:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Resyl Platform] --> B[Direct Brokerage]
    A --> C[Channel Partner / CP Network]
    B -->|isCpProject = false| D[Internal Sales Team sells directly to Buyers]
    C -->|isCpProject = true| E[Sourcing Managers recruit External Brokers]
    E --> F[Closing Managers handle On-Site CP Bookings]
    D & F --> G[(Unified PostgreSQL Database)]
```

### Core Business Invariants
1. **The `isCpProject` Boundary Law**: All inventory (`Project`, `Tower`, `Unit`), leads, and marketing campaigns are strictly scoped by `isCpProject: boolean`. Brokerage and Channel Partner data never bleed across this boundary.
2. **Auth Law**: [Better Auth](file:///c:/Users/Sumama/Desktop/enterprise-crm-realtors/apps/api/src/lib/auth.ts) is the single source of truth for authentication. No custom JWT minting or passport strategies. The user's role is strictly read from `session.user.role`.
3. **Database Law**: All persistence operations must go through the Prisma ORM ([`@resyl/prisma`](file:///c:/Users/Sumama/Desktop/enterprise-crm-realtors/packages/prisma/schema.prisma)). Multi-model mutations require `prisma.$transaction`.
4. **Workers Law**: No heavy I/O, CSV bulk imports, or mass marketing dispatches are performed synchronously inside the HTTP request loop. Everything is queued and processed asynchronously by BullMQ workers ([`apps/workers`](file:///c:/Users/Sumama/Desktop/enterprise-crm-realtors/apps/workers/src/main.ts)).
5. **Integrations Law**: External third-party providers (Email, SMS, Voice, Telephony) are never called directly from API controllers or services. All communication is routed through decoupled adapter packages inside [`integrations/`](file:///c:/Users/Sumama/Desktop/enterprise-crm-realtors/integrations/README.md).

---

## 4. Data & Database Layer (Prisma 7 & PostgreSQL)

The database schema is declared in [`packages/prisma/schema.prisma`](file:///c:/Users/Sumama/Desktop/enterprise-crm-realtors/packages/prisma/schema.prisma) and generated to `@resyl/prisma`.

### Key Data Domains
1. **Identity & RBAC**: `User`, `Account`, `Session`, `Verification`, `Permission`, `RolePermission`, `AuditLog`.
2. **Lead & Customer Entity**:
   - `Lead`: Tracks prospective buyers with `temperature` (`HOT`, `WARM`, `COLD`), `status`, `score` (AI 0-100), `assignedUserId`, `brokerId`, and `interestedProjectId`.
   - `Customer`: Created upon booking conversion; holds KYC, post-sales records, and payment obligations.
3. **Inventory Tree**: `Builder` → `Project` → `Tower` → `Floor` → `Unit` (`AVAILABLE`, `BLOCKED`, `RESERVED`, `SOLD`). Backed by `UnitStatusHistory`, `PriceSheet`, `PaymentPlanTemplate`, and `InventoryDocument`.
4. **Site Visit & Sales Execution**:
   - `SiteVisit`: Physical visit records.
   - `SiteVisitVerification`: Fraud prevention capturing selfie image URL and GPS coordinates.
   - `Negotiation`: Mandatory discount approval record before unit booking.
   - `Booking`: Confirmed sales record linking customer, unit, pricing, and commissions.
5. **Channel Partner Network**:
   - `Broker`: External real estate agent (not a system user).
   - `BrokerMeeting`: GPS-verified field visits by Sourcing Managers.
   - `BrokerageRecord`: Commission computation per CP sale.
   - `BrokerageSettlement`: Two-tier payout disbursement tracking.
6. **Omnichannel Marketing Suite**:
   - `MarketingCampaign`: Broadcast definition (Email, SMS, Voice) with status (`DRAFT`, `SCHEDULED`, `PROCESSING`, `COMPLETED`, `PAUSED`, `FAILED`).
   - `MarketingIntegration`: Configured provider API keys and default identities.
   - `CampaignRecipient`: Recipient-level dispatch status (`QUEUED`, `SENT`, `DELIVERED`, `OPENED`, `CLICKED`, `FAILED`, `BOUNCED`).
   - `EmailTrackingEvent`: Immutable audit log for email opens and link clicks.
   - `MarketingUnsubscribe`: Global suppression list.
   - `SmsCampaign`, `SmsRecipient`, `SmsShortLink`, `SmsTrackingEvent`.
   - `VoiceCampaign`, `VoiceRecipient`, `VoiceCallLog`, `VoiceTelephonyIntegration`, `VoiceAgentIntegration`.

---

## 5. Shared Packages Architecture (`packages/`)

To eliminate code duplication across web, mobile, api, and workers, shared logic is segregated into pure TypeScript Turborepo packages:

### 1. `@resyl/types` ([`packages/types/src/index.ts`](file:///c:/Users/Sumama/Desktop/enterprise-crm-realtors/packages/types/src/index.ts))

### 2. `@resyl/constants` ([`packages/constants/src/index.ts`](file:///c:/Users/Sumama/Desktop/enterprise-crm-realtors/packages/constants/src/index.ts))
Decomposed pure constants and helpers:
- [`email.ts`](file:///c:/Users/Sumama/Desktop/enterprise-crm-realtors/packages/constants/src/email.ts): `EMAIL_PROVIDERS` catalog (AWS SES, SendGrid, Brevo, Mailchimp) with field definitions, badge styles, and provider docs.
- [`sms.ts`](file:///c:/Users/Sumama/Desktop/enterprise-crm-realtors/packages/constants/src/sms.ts): `SMS_PROVIDERS` catalog (Twilio, Gupshup, Sinch, AWS SNS), DLT regulatory categories, character limit counters.
- [`voice/`](file:///c:/Users/Sumama/Desktop/enterprise-crm-realtors/packages/constants/src/voice/):
  - `agents.ts`: Provider models and capabilities for Vapi, Retell, Sarvam, Bolna, ElevenLabs, LiveKit, OpenAI.
  - `telephony.ts`: Carrier specs for Vobiz, Exotel, Twilio, Telnyx.
  - `normalizer.ts`: `normalizeVoiceLeadVariables` helper mapping CRM lead records to AI voice prompt template merge tags.
  - `scripts.ts`: Pre-built real estate cold calling scripts and prompts.
  - `voices.ts`: Curated catalog of neural TTS voices (gender, accent, language, provider).

### 3. `@resyl/validators` ([`packages/validators/src/index.ts`](file:///c:/Users/Sumama/Desktop/enterprise-crm-realtors/packages/validators/src/index.ts))
Zod schemas for lead forms, booking creation, campaign setup, and user input validation.

### 4. `@resyl/prisma` ([`packages/prisma/src/index.ts`](file:///c:/Users/Sumama/Desktop/enterprise-crm-realtors/packages/prisma/src/index.ts))
Prisma client instantiation with singleton pattern for both Node.js ESM server and BullMQ workers.

---

## 6. Integrations Layer (`integrations/`)

External adapters live in isolated packages under `integrations/`:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph apps [Applications]
        API[apps/api]
        Workers[apps/workers]
    end

    subgraph mail [integrations/mail]
        SES[aws-ses]
        SG[sendgrid]
        BR[brevo]
        MC[mailchimp]
    end

    subgraph sms [integrations/sms]
        TW[twilio]
        GS[gupshup]
        SN[sinch]
        SNS[aws-sns]
    end

    subgraph voice [integrations/voice]
        VA[8 Voice Agent Adapters]
        CB[Carrier Bridge Dispatcher]
        TC[4 PSTN Carriers]
    end

    API --> mail & sms & voice
    Workers --> mail & sms & voice
```

### 7.4 Mail Adapters (`integrations/mail/*`)

Each provider package in `integrations/mail/` implements the `IEmailMarketingProvider` contract:

#### 1. AWS SES Adapter ([`integrations/mail/aws-ses/src/index.ts`](file:///c:/Users/Sumama/Desktop/enterprise-crm-realtors/integrations/mail/aws-ses/src/index.ts))
- Implements pure Node.js cryptographic **AWS Signature Version 4 (HMAC-SHA256)** authentication.
- Sends batch outbound emails directly to the Amazon SES v2 REST API (`/v2/email/outbound-emails`).
- Verifies credentials via authenticated `GET /v2/email/account` ping.
- `SesWebhookParser` parses inbound AWS SNS notification payloads for Delivery, Open, Click, Bounce, and Complaint events.

#### 2. SendGrid Adapter ([`integrations/mail/sendgrid/src/index.ts`](file:///c:/Users/Sumama/Desktop/enterprise-crm-realtors/integrations/mail/sendgrid/src/index.ts))
- Validates API keys against SendGrid `/v3/user/profile`.
- Dispatches mail via SendGrid `/v3/mail/send` endpoint.
- Webhook parser translates SendGrid Event Webhooks (`processed`, `delivered`, `open`, `click`, `bounce`, `spamreport`) into unified `EmailWebhookEvent` records.

#### 3. Brevo Adapter ([`integrations/mail/brevo/src/index.ts`](file:///c:/Users/Sumama/Desktop/enterprise-crm-realtors/integrations/mail/brevo/src/index.ts))
- Calls Brevo v3 Transactional Email API (`/v3/smtp/email`).
- Supports strict European data isolation and custom tagging.

#### 4. Mailchimp Mandrill Adapter ([`integrations/mail/mailchimp/src/index.ts`](file:///c:/Users/Sumama/Desktop/enterprise-crm-realtors/integrations/mail/mailchimp/src/index.ts))
- Dispatches via Mandrill `/messages/send.json` API.
- Implements Mandrill webhook signature verification.

### 7.5 Backend API Architecture (`apps/api/src/marketing/email/`)

The email marketing API is structured cleanly into Single-Responsibility controllers and services, tied together via a Coordinator Facade:

```
apps/api/src/marketing/email/
├── controllers/
│   ├── email-campaigns.controller.ts    # POST /campaigns, GET /campaigns, GET /:id, DELETE /:id, POST /:id/dispatch
│   ├── email-integrations.controller.ts # GET /integrations, POST /integrations/connect, DELETE /:id, POST /test
│   ├── email-tracking.controller.ts     # GET /track/open, GET /track/click, GET /unsubscribe
│   └── email-webhooks.controller.ts     # POST /webhooks/:provider (Inbound SES/SendGrid webhooks)
├── services/
│   ├── email-audience.service.ts        # Audience resolution, CSV lead promotion, filter builders
│   ├── email-analytics.service.ts       # Funnel computation, recipient pagination, CTR calculation
│   ├── email-integrations.service.ts    # Adapter resolution, credential verification, test emails
│   └── email-tracking.service.ts        # Open pixel handler, link redirect proxy, unsubscribe suppression
├── dto/
│   └── email.dto.ts                     # CreateCampaignDto, SaveDraftCampaignDto, PreviewAudienceDto, ConnectIntegrationDto
├── email.service.ts                     # Lightweight Coordinator Facade (< 200 lines target)
└── email.service.spec.ts                # Unit tests
```

#### Key API Endpoints
- `POST /api/marketing/email/campaigns`: Accepts `CreateCampaignDto`, evaluates audience filters, eliminates duplicates and unsubscribed emails, creates DB records, and triggers worker dispatch.
- `POST /api/marketing/email/campaigns/draft`: Saves partial work from any wizard step without validation failure.
- `POST /api/marketing/email/audience/preview`: Returns real-time audience count estimate before launching.
- `GET /api/marketing/email/campaigns/:id/analytics`: Returns aggregate delivery, open, click, bounce, and complaint rates with hourly timeline breakdown.
- `GET /api/marketing/track/open`: Returns a 1x1 transparent GIF image (`Content-Type: image/gif`) while recording the open timestamp, IP, and User-Agent in the database.
- `GET /api/marketing/track/click`: Records the link click in `EmailTrackingEvent` and returns an HTTP 302 redirect to the original destination URL.

### 7.6 BullMQ Background Worker

Located at [`apps/workers/src/processors/marketing-email.processor.ts`](file:///c:/Users/Sumama/Desktop/enterprise-crm-realtors/apps/workers/src/processors/marketing-email.processor.ts):

1. **Auto-Scanner & Resilience**: Runs an automated 8-second polling cycle (`scanAndProcessPendingCampaigns()`) that automatically picks up any `PROCESSING`, `SCHEDULED`, or `DRAFT` campaigns with `QUEUED` recipients.
2. **Chunked Batch Processing**: Processes recipients in chunks of 100 to prevent memory pressure.
3. **Dynamic Merge Tag Interpolation**:
   - `{{lead.firstName}}` → Prospect first name
   - `{{lead.lastName}}` → Prospect last name
   - `{{lead.fullName}}` → Full name
   - `{{lead.city}}` → Lead city
   - `{{project.name}}` → Associated property name
   - `{{project.location}}` → Property location/address
   - `{{project.startingPrice}}` → Starting price formatted in Crores/Lakhs
   - `{{project.brochureUrl}}` → Downloadable PDF link
   - `{{agent.name}}` → Assigned sales executive name
   - `{{agent.phone}}` → Assigned sales executive phone number
   - `{{unsubscribeUrl}}` → Dynamic one-click unsubscribe link
4. **Tracking Injection**:
   - **Open Pixel**: Automatically appends `<img src="http://api/track/open?cid=...&rid=..." width="1" height="1" />` to the HTML body.
   - **Link Rewrite**: Scans all `<a href="...">` tags and rewrites them to route through the tracking proxy.
5. **Adapter Execution**: Calls the respective provider adapter's `sendBatch()` method and updates `CampaignRecipient` to `DELIVERED` or `FAILED`.

## 10. Lead Lifecycle, Inventory & Channel Partner (CP) Operations

### 1. Lead Journey
```
NEW ──► CONTACTED ──► INTERESTED ──► QUALIFIED ──► SITE_VISIT_SCHEDULED ──► SITE_VISIT_COMPLETED ──► NEGOTIATION ──► BOOKING ──► DOCUMENT ──► LOAN ──► AGREEMENT ──► HANDOVER
```
- **AI Call Processing**: Background queue transcribes phone audio, extracts budget and preferred locations, scores lead (0-100), and auto-schedules follow-ups without overwriting existing data.
- **GPS-Verified Site Visits**: Executives must upload a selfie and provide verified GPS coordinates at the project site.

### 2. Inventory & AI Tower Generation
- Complete real estate hierarchy: `Builder` → `Project` → `Tower` → `Floor` → `Unit`.
- **AI Tower Generator**: Prompt-based tower generation using Groq LLM committed safely in a single Prisma transaction.

### 3. Channel Partner (CP) Ecosystem
- `isCpProject: true` isolates the external broker network.
- **Sourcing Manager**: Recruits brokers, conducts GPS-verified onboarding meetings, locks commissions.
- **Closing Manager**: Stationed on-site to handle walk-ins and close bookings for broker leads.
- **Brokerage Settlements**: 2-stage approval workflow between Sourcing Managers and Finance.

## 11. Android Native Auto-Dialer & Mobile Architecture (`apps/mobile/`)

Built with Expo 54 and Expo Router 6:
- Custom Native Kotlin Module ([`AutoDialerModule.kt`](file:///c:/Users/Sumama/Desktop/enterprise-crm-realtors/apps/mobile/README.md)) using Android `TelephonyManager` and `PhoneStateListener`.
- Sequential auto-dialing: Pre-sales executives can call lead lists continuously without touching the keypad.
- Background sync via `CallUploadWorker` uploading call durations and recordings to NestJS API.
- Gamified achievement milestones (celebrations triggered upon hitting 1,000, 5,000, 10,000 calls).

---

## 12. Environment Configuration & Split Architecture

Resyl strictly enforces a **Split Environment Architecture**:

```
Root /.env                       Apps Local /.env (apps/api, apps/web, apps/mobile)
├── DATABASE_URL                 ├── FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:3000"
├── BETTER_AUTH_SECRET           ├── BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:3333"
├── BETTER_AUTH_URL              ├── MOBILE_URL="exp://<LAN_IP>:8081"
├── BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN        ├── EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://<LAN_IP>:3333"
├── GROQ_API_KEY                 └── NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
├── REDIS_URL
├── API_PUBLIC_URL (ngrok)
└── Neural TTS Keys (ElevenLabs, Deepgram, Cartesia, Sarvam, etc.)
```

> **Security Rule**: Sensitive server credentials (DB, Auth, Storage, AI Keys) live exclusively in the root `/.env`. App-level `.env` files are restricted to local routing URLs and client-safe public keys.

---

## 13. Monorepo Tooling, Scripts & Verification Commands

All commands are executed from the **monorepo root**:

### 1. Development Servers
```bash
pnpm dev:api                     # Start NestJS API dev server (Port 3333)
pnpm dev:web                     # Start Next.js Web dev server (Port 3000)
pnpm dev:mobile                  # Start Expo Metro bundler
pnpm --filter @resyl/workers start:dev  # Start BullMQ worker cluster
```

### 2. Database Management (`@resyl/prisma`)
```bash
pnpm db:generate                 # Generate Prisma Client to packages/prisma/generated/client
pnpm db:migrate                  # Run pending SQL migrations
pnpm db:seed                     # Populate database with demo users and projects
pnpm --filter @resyl/prisma db:studio   # Open Prisma Studio web GUI
```

### 3. Quality & Build Verification
```bash
pnpm lint                        # ESLint typecheck and linting across all workspaces
pnpm build                       # Turborepo cached production build for all packages & apps
pnpm --filter @resyl/web exec next build  # Full verified Next.js standalone build
pnpm --filter @resyl/api test             # Run backend Jest unit tests (*.spec.ts)
pnpm --filter @resyl/api test:e2e         # Run API end-to-end test suite
```

### 4. Integration Verification Scripts
Root utility scripts executed via `tsx`:
```bash
pnpm run script scripts/test-all-integrations.ts     # Validate all Email, SMS, and Voice adapters
pnpm run script scripts/test-all-voice-providers.ts  # Test Vapi, Retell, Sarvam & ElevenLabs connectivity
pnpm run script scripts/check-integrations.ts        # Validate active database integration records
```

## Summary

Resyl provides an all-in-one real estate brokerage and marketing engine. Its modular architecture cleanly separates:
1. **Shared Logic**: Isolated in pure TypeScript packages (`types`, `constants`, `validators`, `storage`).
2. **Provider Adapters**: Encapsulated in `integrations/` (Mail, SMS, Voice).
3. **Async Workers**: Processing long-running jobs via BullMQ in `apps/workers`.
4. **Presentation & API**: Responsive Next.js App Router dashboard, Android native Expo app, and modular NestJS API.
